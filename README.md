# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-App
Accurate property valuation is critical for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in dynamic and competitive housing markets. This project presents an end-to-end Real Estate Price Prediction Application that leverages machine learning and modern web technologies to estimate flat prices in major metropolitan cities like Bangalore, Chennai, and others.
Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant or incomplete entries, handling missing values, and normalizing the input data.
Feature Engineering: Extracting and transforming meaningful features such as the number of BHKs, location, and total square footage.
Encoding and Scaling: Converting categorical variables (e.g., location) into numerical form using one-hot encoding and applying feature scaling for uniformity.
Model Training: Applying Linear Regression to map input features to the property price, optimizing for minimal mean squared error.
This project demonstrates the practical integration of machine learning, computer vision (face recognition), and full-stack web development to solve a real-world problem. It serves as a strong foundation for more advanced pricing models (e.g., decision trees, ensemble methods, deep learning), while also showcasing how AI can enhance usability and security in user-facing applications.
